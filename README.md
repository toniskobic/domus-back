# Domus - ASP.NET Core Web API

Domus is a React and ASP.NET Core application for organizing social events in student dormitories. React application was bootstrapped with [Devias Kit - React Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/devias-io/material-kit-react) template. React app and ASP.NET Core web API are in seperated repositories. This repo contains the ASP.NET Core Web API.
